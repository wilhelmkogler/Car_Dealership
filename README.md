<p align="justify">This section showcases the vehicles that are available for both purchase and rental. Users can easily browse through the listings using various filter and sorting options based on specific criteria. Each car is presented with high-quality images and detailed specifications to help users make informed decisions. The entire section was built using CSS for styling, PHP for backend logic, and SQL queries to fetch data from a MySQL database. The cars are dynamically displayed, allowing for real-time updates and seamless interaction with the content.</p>


<h3>Question form</h3>

<p align="justify">On the home page, there is a custom question submission form where users can ask their own questions. These messages are sent directly to the site administrator's email address provided in the backend. This feature was implemented using a PHP library called PHPMailer, which handles the secure and reliable sending of emails.

<h3>Loan Calculator</h3>

With the click of a button, the monthly payment is displayed. This feature was built using JavaScript and jQuery to ensure smooth and interactive functionality.</p>
